# Goflix

Goflix is a self-hosted media streaming platform built using Golang, designed to simplify sharing and streaming video and audio content within a local network.  Users can easily share media files from their local storage with others on the same network and create interactive watch parties or simply enjoy casual streaming sessions. The application also provides real-time chat feature for the users to interact with each other during streaming. Golang’s efficient memory usage and concurrency helps in offering a smooth streaming experience. We use sqlite to store chats related to every session and  livego for streaming media content. We are using wails for for building the user interface of the application, due to the ease it provides in distributing the application across Windows, Linux, and macOS.
